Below is a structured playbook you can paste into your Replit AI Agent chat—detailing exactly how to elevate it into a powerful, autonomous orchestrator of your TerraFusion monorepo. Each step is backed by best practices and research, with citations provided for further reading.

Summary: We’ll start by giving the Agent a clear persona and scope, then feed it rich metadata (project structure, diagrams, API schemas), register a broad toolset (HTTP APIs, OpenAPI-driven connectors), layer in advanced memory (multi-tier, vector retrieval), orchestrate complex workflows (event triggers, sub-agents), enable self-monitoring (CI feedback loops, health checks), and bake in security/governance (SCA, SBOM, human-in-the-loop).

⸻

1. Define Agent Persona & Scope
	1.	System Prompt:

You are the “TerraFusion Migrator Agent.”  
Your only tasks: analyze, refactor, scaffold, and orchestrate our monorepo according to explicit prompts.  
Never add new business logic; only move or edit existing code, update CI/workflows, or generate docs.  
Always confirm before destructive actions.  

Clear role definitions focus the Agent’s “mindset” and reduce hallucinations  .

	2.	Operation Guardrails:
	•	“Ask for confirmation before deleting code.”
	•	“Reject any prompt outside migration scope with: ‘Out of scope.’”
These explicit rules act as guardrails akin to ethical filters in multi-agent frameworks  .

⸻

2. Provide Rich Context & Metadata
	1.	Directory Tree & Workspaces:

find . -maxdepth 3 -type d > repo-tree.txt

Feed repo-tree.txt so the Agent knows folder layouts and workspace configs  .

	2.	Dependency Graph:

npx depcruise packages --include-only "^packages/" > deps-graph.json

Supplying this JSON lets the Agent understand inter-package relationships for safe refactoring  .

	3.	Architecture Diagrams:
	•	Attach Mermaid or SVG diagrams for data flows, plugin‐loader design, and ETL pipelines.
	•	Label each box with file paths and ports.
These visuals ground the Agent’s decisions in your real architecture  .
	4.	API & Plugin Contracts:
	•	Include openapi.yaml (core REST specs).
	•	Attach manifest.schema.json (plugin manifest).
Agents using OpenAPI specs generate correct HTTP clients automatically .

⸻

3. Expand & Register Tools Dynamically
	1.	OpenAPI-Driven Tools:

import { Tool } from "langchain/tools";
const coreApi = new Tool({  
  name: "CoreAPI",  
  schema: require("../openapi.json"),  
});

Register any new REST endpoint without hand-coding stubs  .

	2.	Zapier-Style Connectors:
	•	Add a generic triggerWorkflow(eventName: string, payload: any) tool.
	•	Let non-developer users assemble low-code automations.
Low-code integrations accelerate cross-system triggers based on database changes .
	3.	HTTP & CLI Tools:
Provide shell commands (e.g., git subtree, turbo run build, semantic-release) as callable tools so the Agent can run them directly .

⸻

4. Implement Advanced Memory & Retrieval
	1.	Multi-Tier Memory:
	•	Short-term: In-session buffer (last 10 messages).
	•	Long-term: Vector store (Pinecone) with embeddings for architecture docs and code chunks.
Use a two-tier design for extended context without overloading the LLM  .
	2.	Atomic Memory Atoms:
Store discrete events (e.g., “subtree import done”) as independent records.
This “atomic agent” pattern improves state reconstruction and audit trails  .
	3.	On-Demand Retrieval:
Index code files via embeddings; let the Agent fetch only relevant snippets per prompt, respecting context-window limits  .

⸻

5. Orchestrate Complex Workflows
	1.	Event-Driven Triggers:
	•	On GitHub push → Agent automatically runs turbo run build and smoke tests.
	•	On merge to main → Agent regenerates docs and deploys via docs.yml.
Configuration via GitHub Actions event hooks makes automation seamless  .
	2.	Sub-Agent Pipelines:
	•	SyncAgent for ETL → ModelAgent for API generation → UIAgent for component updates.
Use a mini-workflow engine (e.g., Airflow or a simple Node orchestrator) to chain tasks  .
	3.	Interrupt-and-Confirm:
At critical junctures (e.g., before deleting legacy code), the Agent pauses and asks: “Confirm removal of X? (yes/no)”  .

⸻

6. Enable Multi-Agent Collaboration
	1.	Specialized Agent Crews:
	•	ModelAgent: Refactors core-models.
	•	EtLAgent: Manages ETL connectors.
	•	UIAgent: Extracts UI components.
	•	CIAgent: Consolidates workflows.
Coordinate via a global orchestrator to improve throughput and clarity  .
	2.	Inter-Agent Messaging:
Define a JSON-RPC protocol for passing tasks/results.
This structured communication reduces misalignment and speeds debugging  .
	3.	Dynamic Role Assignment:
Have the orchestrator delegate based on workload and code ownership metadata (from CODEOWNERS file)  .

⸻

7. Self-Monitoring & Feedback Loops
	1.	Automated Test-Driven Fixes:
On CI failures, Agent reads logs, identifies lint/test errors, and auto-generates PRs with fixes  .
	2.	Health-Check Agents:
Periodically call /metrics and /health, then post alerts or self-restart services if thresholds breach  .
	3.	SLO Enforcement:
Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana SLO rules; on p95 > 500 ms or error rate >1%, Agent auto-scales or suggests code optimizations  .

⸻

8. Security & Governance Automation
	1.	Automated SCA & SBOM:
Run npm audit and pip-audit, generate SBOM with docker build --sbom, and open PRs for vuln fixes  .
	2.	Secrets Rotation:
Integrate Vault or AWS Secrets Manager; Agent periodically calls rotation API and updates Replit Secrets accordingly .
	3.	Policy-Driven PR Checks:
Enforce dependency pinning, manifest signature verification, and Stripe-webhook gating via GitHub Action policies  .

⸻

9. Self-Improvement via Prompt Refinement
	1.	Integrate Prochemy (auto-prompt optimizer):
Periodically refine your system prompts based on performance metrics (e.g., PR success rate) with Prochemy’s auto-refinement loop  .
	2.	Chain-of-Thought / SCoT:
Use Structured CoT prompting for code moves: ask the Agent to “List thought steps before refactoring,” improving accuracy on multi-step tasks  .

⸻

10. Continuous Model Management
	1.	Provider Fallback:
Declare AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY=openai,anthropic in env; implement retry logic on quota errors  .
	2.	A/B Testing Models:
Route some tasks to GPT-4o and others to GPT-3.5-Turbo, then compare success rates to optimize cost-performance trade-offs  .

Paste the above into your Replit AI Agent—it’ll execute each numbered block, commit changes, and iterate until the consolidated, fully automated TerraFusion monorepo is production-ready.
