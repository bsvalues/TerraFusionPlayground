Below is a set of high-impact features you can ask the Replit AI Agent to implement next in the TerraFusion monorepo, each grounded in industry best practices.

In summary, you should prioritize building robust end-to-end testing, rich observability and SLO dashboards, a self-service developer portal with SDKs, multi-region deployment support, optimized mobile vector-tile rendering, and faster CI pipelines via Turborepo caching. Each of these will strengthen platform reliability, scalability, developer experience, and performance.

1. End-to-End Testing with Playwright

Implement full Playwright E2E tests to cover critical user journeys (login, plugin install, map interactions), using isolated tests, web-first assertions, and CI integration for reliability  ￼ ￼.

2. SLO-Driven Observability Dashboard

Build a Prometheus + Grafana dashboard that captures service p95 latency and error-rate SLOs, instrumenting NestJS endpoints and BullMQ queues to meet enterprise monitoring standards  ￼ ￼.

3. Self-Service Developer Portal

Create a developer portal featuring interactive API docs, SDK downloads, and CLI examples. Developer portals boost onboarding speed, ensure standards compliance, and reduce integration friction  ￼ ￼.

4. Multi-Region Kubernetes Deployments

Define Helm charts and Terraform modules for multi-region clusters with latency-based routing, read-replica Postgres, and Redis clusters. This ensures high availability and disaster recovery per cloud-native best practices  ￼ ￼.

5. Mobile Vector-Tile Rendering

Switch to MVT (Mapbox Vector Tiles) stored in MBTiles or PostGIS for mobile apps, and implement client-side dynamic styling to optimize performance and offline usage  ￼ ￼.

6. Turborepo CI Caching

Configure GitHub Actions with actions/cache for the .turbo folder and use Turborepo’s --filter flags to dramatically reduce CI build times and keep pipelines snappy  ￼ ￼.

These six enhancements will give you a clear, prioritized roadmap for the next phase of TerraFusion’s evolution—improving quality, observability, developer friendliness, scalability, and performance.
