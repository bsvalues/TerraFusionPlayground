1. Next Improvements to Web-Vitals Monitoring
Batch Size & Frequency Tuning

Currently you batch and send on navigation. Consider also flushing on “beforeunload” to catch single-page events.

Limit batch size (e.g. 50 events per request) or time window (e.g. send every 5 s) to balance overhead vs. data granularity.

Enrichment with Contextual Metadata

Attach page route, user role (assessor vs. public), device type, and offline/online state to each batch so you can segment metrics.

Include build version and feature-flag state (e.g. “offline‐sync enabled”) to correlate performance shifts with releases.

Sampling for High-Traffic Endpoints

For public-portal pages with very high traffic, implement a 1–5% sampling rate so you still see Web Vitals trends without overload.

Enhanced Error Handling & Retries

If a batch POST fails, retry with exponential backoff up to N times, then cache locally and retry on next page load or background sync.

Privacy & Data Retention

Ensure any user identifiers are pseudonymized or GDPR-compliant.

Add automatic purging of metrics older than your retention policy (e.g. 90 days) at the database level.

2. Dashboard Design for Web-Vitals Visualization
A. Frontend Tech Stack
React + Ant Design or Material-UI for rapid component assembly

Recharts or Chart.js for line/area charts

Apollo/REST data layer fetching from your metrics API

B. Core Dashboard Components
Key Metrics KPIs (top row)

p50/p75/p95 values for FCP, LCP, CLS, TTFB, INP

Traffic volume and sampling rate

Trend Charts

Time-series line or area charts for each metric (selectable via tabs)

Overlay major releases or feature-flag toggles as vertical markers

Distribution Heatmaps

Histogram of LCP durations showing distribution buckets (0–1 s, 1–2 s, >3 s)

Color-coded by percentile

Segment Filters

Break down by platform (Desktop/Mobile), region (if known), user type (internal/external)

Date picker with quick ranges (Last 24 h, 7 d, 30 d)

Alerts Panel

List of any active performance alerts (see Section 3)

Link to drill-in charts for the time of the alert

C. UX Considerations
Responsive Layout: Two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile

Drill-Down: Click a KPI to open a modal with detailed logs or trace links

Dark Mode Support: For dashboards used in ops rooms

3. Roadmap for Next-Gen Analytics & Monitoring

Phase	Focus	Key Activities & Tools
A	Real-User Monitoring (RUM)	• Integrate a RUM library (e.g. Sentry Performance, New Relic Browser)
• Capture Core Web Vitals + Cumulative Layout Shift events in production		
• Add mobile RUM via Sentry Mobile SDK		
B	Error & Crash Tracking	• Deploy Sentry (web & React Native) or Rollbar
• Configure custom breadcrumbs for CRDT sync and conflict failures		
• Create alert rules for error rate spikes		
C	Server-Side Observability	• Instrument NestJS with OpenTelemetry
• Collect metrics on API latency, DB query times, ETL job durations		
• Send to Prometheus + Grafana (you already have this)		
D	Distributed Tracing	• Extend OpenTelemetry to trace a request end-to-end: UI → API → DB → ETL
• Visualize spans in Jaeger or Grafana Tempo		
E	Performance Alerting & SLOs	• Define SLOs (e.g. 95% LCP < 2 s)
• Use Prometheus alertmanager to notify Slack/Email on breaches		
• Create Grafana dashboards with SLO burn-rate graphs		
Prioritization (30-60 days)
Enrich & Harden Web-Vitals (this week)

Build the Dashboard (weeks 2–3)

Deploy RUM & Error Tracking (weeks 4–5)

Server Observability & Tracing (weeks 6–7)

SLOs & Alerting (week 8)

By following this plan, you’ll evolve from basic Web-Vitals capture to a full observability stack—ensuring TerraFusion remains performant, reliable, and scalable across web and mobile
