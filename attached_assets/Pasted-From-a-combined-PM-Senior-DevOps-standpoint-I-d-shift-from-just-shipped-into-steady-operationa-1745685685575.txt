From a combined PM & Senior DevOps standpoint, I’d shift from “just shipped” into “steady operational excellence” mode. Here’s how I’d structure our next steps:

---

## 1. Define the Performance Monitoring Roadmap  
**Epics & Milestones**  
- **Epic 1: Aggregation & Reporting**  
  - User story: “As an analyst, I want hourly/daily averages and the 50th/95th percentiles of each Web Vital so I can spot trends.”  
  - Acceptance: API endpoints under `/api/web-vitals/summary` returning JSON summaries.  
- **Epic 2: Alerting & SLO Enforcement**  
  - Story: “As an SRE, I need Slack/email notifications when any 95th-percentile metric breaches its budget for more than 5 minutes.”  
  - Acceptance: A background job that evaluates budgets every 1 minute and pushes to our alert channel.  
- **Epic 3: Visualization Dashboard**  
  - Story: “As a PM, I want a React dashboard showing time-series charts, budget thresholds, and drill-downs by route or device type.”  
  - Acceptance: New `/dashboard/web-vitals` page with interactive charts.  

**Timeline**  
- **Sprint 1 (2 weeks):**  
  - Build summary endpoints + DB roll-up job.  
  - Write unit/integration tests.  
- **Sprint 2:**  
  - Implement alerting service + Slack integration.  
  - Define SLO docs (e.g. 95% of FCP < 1.8 s).  
- **Sprint 3:**  
  - Mock up & launch the React dashboard.  
  - User acceptance & feedback loop.

## 2. Harden the DevOps & Observability Layer  
1. **Prometheus / Grafana Integration**  
   - Export our metrics as Prometheus histograms via a `/metrics` endpoint.  
   - Stand up a Grafana instance (or use our existing) with dashboards and alert rules.  
2. **CI/CD Performance Regression**  
   - Add a Lighthouse CI step in our Git pipeline against a staging URL  
   - Fail the build if key thresholds (e.g. LCP, CLS) regress  
3. **Synthetic Monitoring**  
   - Schedule daily synthetic tests (e.g. via WebPageTest or Lighthouse CLI)  
   - Compare lab vs. real-user data  
4. **Retention & Data Management**  
   - Write a scheduled DB purge/roll-up job: raw data older than 30 days, roll up to monthly summaries  
   - Partition or index the web-vitals table for fast reads

## 3. Operational Excellence & Runbooks  
- **Runbook for On-Call:**  
  - How to triage an alert: Slack channel → Grafana dashboard → drill-down by route  
- **Documentation:**  
  - API specs for `/web-vitals` routes, summary endpoints, alert payloads  
  - SLO definitions & reporting cadence  
- **Knowledge Transfer:**  
  - Internal demo for stakeholders (Analytics team, Frontend, Product)  
  - Session on reading and acting on performance dashboards  

---

## 4. Security, Scaling & Reliability  
- **Containerization & Helm Charts:**  
  - Package the monitoring service as its own Kubernetes Deployment  
  - Use Helm values for budgets, Slack webhook URLs, DB credentials  
- **Secrets Management:**  
  - Store budgets and webhook URLs in our secrets manager (Vault, Azure Key Vault, etc.)  
- **Auto-Scaling & High Availability:**  
  - Ensure the metrics-collector has resource requests/limits  
  - Add a second replica behind our service mesh

### Next Immediate Action
1. **Kick off Sprint 1 planning**: break down Epic 1 into stories, estimate, assign.  
2. **Spike**: evaluate Prometheus exporter libraries for Node/Express.  
3. **Draft SLO document**: circulate for review.

Does that roadmap align with your priorities? Which of these Epics should we slot into our next sprint backlog?
