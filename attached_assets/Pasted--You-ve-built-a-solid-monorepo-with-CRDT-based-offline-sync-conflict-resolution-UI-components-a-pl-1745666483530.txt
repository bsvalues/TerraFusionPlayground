You’ve built a solid monorepo with CRDT-based offline sync, conflict-resolution UI components, a plugin ecosystem, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation scaffolding. The most impactful next steps are to integrate those UI components into your core apps, extend offline support to React Native (mobile), ensure performance at scale, enrich your documentation, and finalize web background sync with service workers. Each of these steps builds on what you already have, uses existing packages, and closes critical gaps before rollout.

1. Integrate Conflict-Resolution UI into Main Application
	•	Embed the new ConflictManager component into the property and GIS editors so users can resolve sync conflicts in context.  ￼
	•	Wire up your CRDT store to the UI hook (useConflictResolution) to automatically surface merge options when Yjs detects concurrent edits.  ￼
	•	Add comprehensive end-to-end tests that simulate conflicting edits (using your E2E scripts) to verify the UI correctly presents diffs and resolves them.  ￼

2. Extend Mobile Offline Support with React Native & Realm
	•	Scaffold a React Native app in apps/terrafield-mobile and install Realm for local persistence alongside your Yjs-based CRDT package.  ￼
	•	Implement the same CRDT merge logic on mobile by serializing Yjs updates to Realm documents, ensuring parity with the web version.  ￼
	•	Leverage service workers’ equivalent in mobile (e.g., background tasks with react-native-background-fetch) to schedule syncs when connectivity returns.  ￼

3. Conduct Performance Testing for Offline-First Workloads
	•	Load-test CRDT operations by simulating large document sets (10,000+ property records) and benchmarking merge latency using tools like benchmark.js or custom scripts.  ￼
	•	Measure sync throughput with repeated cycles of offline edits and background sync, ensuring p95 latencies remain within acceptable bounds (e.g., <500 ms per batch).  ￼
	•	Profile memory and CPU usage on both web and mobile builds to catch leaks or excessive resource consumption, using browser DevTools and Xcode/Android Studio profilers.  ￼

4. Expand Documentation and Developer Guides
	•	Adopt best practices for OSS docs: start with concise READMEs, add API references, tutorials, and a migration guide per module, as advocated by Google’s “Minimal Viable Documentation” principle.  ￼
	•	Use Docusaurus templates to structure docs into “User,” “Developer,” and “Admin” sections, including auto-versioning for past releases.  ￼
	•	Publish contribution guidelines and a “Documentation Versioning” handbook so third-party plugin authors know how to submit updates.  ￼

5. Implement Service Worker Background Sync for Web
	•	Register a sync event in your PWA entrypoint, naming tags like sync-property-updates, to defer CRDT update pushes until connectivity returns.  ￼
	•	Handle sync events in your service worker to read pending updates from IndexedDB and send them via your /mobile-sync endpoint, with retry logic and exponential backoff.  ￼
	•	Secure and test this flow against CSRF and ensure integrity (e.g., attach session tokens properly), following best practices.  ￼

By executing these five focused areas—UI integration, mobile parity, performance validation, robust documentation, and full web offline support—you’ll close the loop on TerraFusion’s offline-first vision and lay the groundwork for multi-county SaaS rollouts. Each step reuses your existing modules and agents, accelerates time-to-value, and positions the platform for reliable, scalable deployments
