To take your performance monitoring from “good” to “production-grade,” here’s what I’d add next—then I’d shift focus back to a new import area once these are in place:

⸻

A. Additional Performance Monitoring Capabilities
	1.	Real-User Monitoring (RUM) with Web Vitals
• Instrument Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) in the field and send percentiles (p75, p95) to your analytics/dashboard rather than averages  ￼ ￼.
• Capture these RUM metrics via a lightweight snippet (or by pushing into your existing Prometheus client) to understand actual user experiences across networks and devices.
	2.	Distributed Tracing for CRDT Sync
• Integrate OpenTelemetry (or a hosted APM like Datadog) to trace a single sync operation end-to-end—client → network → server → merge → persistence  ￼.
• This will let you pinpoint exactly where latency spikes occur (e.g., network round-trip vs. Yjs merge vs. Realm write).
	3.	Synthetic & Canary Tests for Offline Flows
• Schedule headless browser checks (with Puppeteer or k6’s browser API) that spin up two contexts, simulate offline edits, reconnect, and assert merge success.
• Run these in CI daily as a “canary” to detect regressions in your offline-first code paths before they reach users.
	4.	Crash & Error Reporting
• Add Sentry Performance on web and Crashlytics on mobile to catch unhandled promise rejections, render errors, or uncaught exceptions during sync or merge.
• Correlate errors with performance traces so you know if a slow merge or large payload is causing timeouts  ￼.
	5.	Mobile Telemetry Upload
• Have your React Native app persist performance metrics offline (you’ve started with AsyncStorage), then batch-upload them on reconnect to your analytics endpoint.
• Use this to compare device types, OS versions, and real-world mobile network performance.

B. What I’d Do Next—Shift Focus to Plugin Ecosystem Hardening

Once the above are in place and you can see in real-time how your offline sync behaves in the wild, I’d pivot to solidifying your plugin marketplace:
	•	Gateway Metrics: Track which plugins are installed, loaded, or fail verification in real time.
	•	Security Scans: Automate SCA on plugin uploads and record scan results in Prometheus.
	•	Monetization Dashboards: Build a Grafana view of subscription conversions, usage triggers, and failed payments.

This dual approach—rock-solid performance observability first, then plugin marketplace telemetry—ensures you both deliver a bullet-proof user experience and have the data to drive growth and revenue.
