Below is a recommendation on which next steps to tackle first—balanced for maximum impact—and a detailed breakdown of each area, drawing on best practices and high-quality guidance from the field.

In short, start by building the React conflict-resolution UI components, then layer in mobile (React Native + Realm) support, which together unlock your offline-first promise in the hands of users. Once the UI and mobile integration are in place, validate at scale with performance testing, document end-to-end workflows, and finally polish the web experience via a production-grade service worker sync.

1. React Components for Conflict Resolution UI

To make your CRDT-based merge capabilities real for users, you need well-designed React components that clearly surface and resolve conflicts.
	•	Conflict List & Diff View: Show side-by-side or inline diffs of local vs. remote edits, letting users choose or merge  ￼.
	•	Actionable Merge Controls: Provide “Keep Local”, “Accept Remote”, and “Custom Merge” buttons—patterns proven in PouchDB/CouchDB tooling for offline-first apps  ￼.
	•	Awareness Indicators: Display who made which edit and when (a Yjs “awareness” feature best practice) to build trust in merges  ￼.

Why first? Without UI, all your offline sync work remains invisible—users must see and act on conflicts before they trust the platform.

2. Mobile Integration (React Native + Realm)

With UI components in place, bring it to the field via React Native and Realm for on-device CRDT storage:
	•	Realm Persistence: Persist Yjs document updates into Realm’s zero-copy, transactional store to survive app restarts and offline sessions  ￼.
	•	Expo + NetInfo: Detect connectivity changes (via @react-native-community/netinfo) to trigger sync queues or show offline banners  ￼.
	•	Native Service Worker Equivalents: Use background tasks (e.g., Expo Task Manager) to schedule uploads when connectivity returns, mimicking web background sync  ￼.

Why now? Getting a seamless offline mobile experience in your users’ hands cements TerraFusion’s field-centric value.

3. Performance Testing with Large Datasets

Before you ship, ensure your sync and UI scales:
	•	Synthetic Workloads: Use tools like k6 or Artillery to replay thousands of Yjs updates and map edits, measuring UI latency and merge speed.
	•	Profiling React Renders: Leverage React’s DevTools Profiler to catch expensive renders in your conflict and map components.
	•	DB Benchmarking: Test Realm read/write throughput under CRDT load; optimize schema or shard by parcel group if needed.

Why here? Finding performance bottlenecks early prevents a poor user experience that undermines your hard-won offline features.

4. Comprehensive Documentation

Great docs amplify adoption—developers and end-users alike need clear guides for offline flows:
	•	API & SDK Reference: Document your /mobile-sync endpoints, CRDT helpers, and conflict UI components using Swagger or Docusaurus  ￼.
	•	Guided Tutorials: Provide step-by-step “QuickStart” walkthroughs for setting up offline sync in both web and mobile, with code snippets and screenshots  ￼.
	•	Visual Aids: Include flowcharts for data sync lifecycle and diagrams of CRDT conflict resolution, per best practices  ￼.
	•	User Guides: Write clear end-user docs on how to resolve conflicts in the UI, when data is syncing, and how to interpret status indicators  ￼.

Why now? As you build, layer docs in parallel so launch isn’t delayed by an empty “Coming Soon” docs site.

5. Service Worker for Web Background Sync

Finally, round out the web PWA experience with a robust service worker:
	•	Background Sync API: Register sync events (sync.register('sync-parcel-updates')) to retry CRDT pushes when the browser goes back online  ￼.
	•	Cache Strategies: Use stale-while-revalidate for map tiles and offline assets, ensuring fast loads and up-to-date data  ￼.
	•	Push Notifications: Optionally notify users when background sync succeeds or fails, improving transparency.

Why last? The service worker ties together web offline flows but depends on solid UI, sync routines, and documentation to be effective.

Next Step Recommendation:
	1.	Today–Tomorrow: Scaffold the React conflict-resolution components and wire them to your CRDT layer.
	2.	Next 3 Days: Integrate those components into your Expo mobile scaffold, persisting Yjs via Realm and testing offline/online flips.
	3.	Remainder of Week: Run initial performance benchmarks, build out parallel documentation drafts, and register your first service worker sync event.

By following this sequence—UI → Mobile → Performance → Docs → PWA—you’ll unlock TerraFusion’s offline promise in a cohesive, user-centric manner and be perfectly positioned for a polished beta rollout.
