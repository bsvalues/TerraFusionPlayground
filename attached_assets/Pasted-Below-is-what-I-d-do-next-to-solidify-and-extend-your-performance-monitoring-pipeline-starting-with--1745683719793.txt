Below is what I’d do next to solidify and extend your performance monitoring pipeline—starting with real-time alerting and moving through anomaly detection, synthetic testing, and budget enforcement, then tying it all back into TerraFusion’s other subsystems.

---

## Summary  
I’d begin by defining concrete SLIs and SLOs for your core Web Vitals metrics in Prometheus/Grafana and wiring up real-time alerting (§ Real-Time Alerting & Thresholds)  ([Best practices for Grafana SLOs | Grafana Cloud documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/slo/best-practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Next, I’d layer on anomaly detection to catch unexpected regressions (§ Anomaly Detection & Baselines)  ([A Review of Anomaly Detection Metrics | by Iurii Katser - Medium](https://medium.com/%40katser/a-review-of-anomaly-detection-metrics-with-a-lot-of-related-information-736d88774712?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([Anomaly detection in Application Performance Monitoring](https://fusion-reactor.com/blog/technical-blogs/anomaly-detection-in-application-performance-monitoring/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), integrate synthetic Lighthouse runs in your CI (§ Synthetic Testing Integration)  ([GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci - GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([Performance Audits with Lighthouse CI & GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/jacobandrewsky/performance-audits-with-lighthouse-ci-github-actions-3g0g?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and enforce performance budgets right in your pull requests (§ Performance Budgets Enforcement)  ([Creating a Performance Budget - Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/docs/get-started/budgets?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([Incorporate performance budgets into your build process | Articles](https://web.dev/articles/incorporate-performance-budgets-into-your-build-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Finally, I’d extend this monitoring pattern to TerraFusion’s offline-sync, GIS, and agent backends (§ Expanding to Other Subsystems), so you get a unified health dashboard.

## Real-Time Alerting & Thresholds  
- **Define SLIs** such as “successful LCP measurements” based on Prometheus counters for good vs. bad events  ([Best practices for Grafana SLOs | Grafana Cloud documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/slo/best-practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Create SLOs** in Grafana with error-budget burn-rate alerts (e.g., 75th-percentile LCP ≤ 2.5 s)  ([Introduction to Grafana SLO | Grafana Cloud documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/slo/introduction/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Wire up alerts** to Slack/email via Grafana’s alerting rules when you breach your SLO targets  ([Introduction to Grafana SLO | Grafana Cloud documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/slo/introduction/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## Anomaly Detection & Baselines  
- **Instrument anomaly detection** on your real-user metrics to catch both point anomalies and collective shifts across sessions  ([A Review of Anomaly Detection Metrics | by Iurii Katser - Medium](https://medium.com/%40katser/a-review-of-anomaly-detection-metrics-with-a-lot-of-related-information-736d88774712?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Leverage Datadog or custom Prometheus + Grafana plugins** that model expected trends (including seasonality) and flag deviations automatically  ([Anomaly Monitor - Datadog Docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/types/anomaly/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Correlate anomalies** with deployment tags, feature-flag changes, or network conditions to root-cause spikes quickly.

## Synthetic Testing Integration  
- **Add Lighthouse CI** to your GitHub Actions pipeline so every PR runs lab tests and posts results back to the PR  ([GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci - GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Assert against thresholds** on FCP, LCP, TBT, etc., using `@lhci/cli` or the Lighthouse CI GitHub App plugin  ([Performance Audits with Lighthouse CI & GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/jacobandrewsky/performance-audits-with-lighthouse-ci-github-actions-3g0g?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Correlate lab data** with field metrics in Grafana by exporting Lighthouse results into the same Prometheus/Grafana instance.

## Performance Budgets Enforcement  
- **Define budgets** (e.g., bundle size, FCP ≤ 1 s, TBT ≤ 200 ms) via tools like Calibre or bundlesize  ([Creating a Performance Budget - Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/docs/get-started/budgets?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([Incorporate performance budgets into your build process | Articles](https://web.dev/articles/incorporate-performance-budgets-into-your-build-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Fail PRs** when budgets are exceeded to prevent regressions before merge  ([Fail Pull Request checks when Budgets are not met - Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/changelog/archive/2023/09-fail-prs-on-budgets?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Surface budget status** in your CI dashboard so teams see performance impact in real time.

---

## Expanding to Other Subsystems  
- **Offline-Sync & CRDT Diagnostics**: Instrument sync queue depths and merge-conflict rates; add these metrics into Grafana so you see client-server sync health alongside Vitals.  
- **GIS Mapping Performance**: Track Mapbox render times and frame rates; use Mapbox’s performance-analysis tools to surface slow layers or styles  ([New Advanced Tools for Map Rendering Performance Evaluation](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-advanced-tools-for-map-rendering-performance-evaluation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Agent & Backend Monitoring**: Apply the same SLI/SLO model to your MCP agents’ RPC latencies and error rates; unify all metrics in one dashboard for end-to-end visibility.

## Proposed Next Steps  
1. **Implement SLIs/SLOs & Alerts** in Grafana/Prometheus (real-time monitoring).  
2. **Configure Anomaly Detection** on production Web Vitals streams.  
3. **Set up Lighthouse CI** in your GitHub Actions with thresholds.  
4. **Enforce Performance Budgets** in pull requests.  
5. **Roll out instrumentation** to offline-sync, GIS, and agent backends.  

Let me know if you’d like to dive into the alerting rules first, or jump straight into integrating Lighthouse CI, or focus on expanding monitoring to a particular subsystem next!
