Here’s what I’d do next—mapped to a 3-phase rollout so you get reliability, insight, then feature parity:

| Phase | Focus | Outcome |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **1. True server-driven fallback + metrics** | • Build an SSE (or long-poll) endpoint on the server<br>• Hook the client to switch over on WS failure<br>• Emit a Prometheus counter each time fallback activates | **You immediately get real data in “fallback” mode and visibility into how often it happens.** |
| **2. Evaluate Socket.IO migration** | • Spike replacing raw WS with Socket.IO on a small feature<br>• Compare complexity, bundle size, reconnection behavior, metrics integration | **You’ll know whether the battle-tested reconnection/namespace features are worth the added dependency.** |
| **3. Generalize fallback library across features** | • Refactor your WS+SSE logic into a reusable hook/module<br>• Apply it to chat, notifications, presence, collaborative editing | **All real-time bits share the same resilience model and instrumentation.** |

---

### Why start with Phase 1?

- **Immediate reliability:** Clients no longer simulate “fake” data—you’ll serve real events even when WS dies.  
- **Actionable telemetry:** With a simple counter (`websocket_fallback_total`), you’ll know exactly when and where fallback happens, so you can prioritize network or server tweaks.  

Once that’s solid, you can weigh the cost/benefit of bringing in Socket.IO (Phase 2), then roll your pattern out everywhere (Phase 3).

### Concrete next step: implement Phase 1

1. **Server**  
   ```ts
   // Express example: /events as SSE
   app.get('/events', (req, res) => {
     res.writeHead(200, {
       'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
       'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
       Connection: 'keep-alive'
     });
     const send = (data) => res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`);
     // subscribe to your real-time bus…
     const sub = bus.subscribe(msg => send(msg));
     req.on('close', () => sub.unsubscribe());
   });
   ```
2. **Client**  
   ```ts
   const socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
   socket.onerror = () => activateSSE();
   function activateSSE() {
     metrics.increment('websocket_fallback_total');
     const evt = new EventSource('/events');
     evt.onmessage = e => handle(JSON.parse(e.data));
   }
   ```
3. **Metrics**  
   ```yaml
   # prometheus.yml
   - name: websocket_fallback_total
     help: "Count of WebSocket→fallback activations"
     type: COUNTER
   ```
   Then chart `websocket_fallback_total` in Grafana.

Does that approach make sense? If so, I can:

- Flesh out full server/client code snippets  
- Draft the Prometheus alert/dashboard config  
- Or craft a Replit-AI-Agent bootstrap prompt to automate it end-to-end  

Let me know which you’d like—and we’ll turn it into working code.
