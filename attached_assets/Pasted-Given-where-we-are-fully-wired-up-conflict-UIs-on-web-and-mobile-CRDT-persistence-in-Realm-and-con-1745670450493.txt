Given where we are—fully wired‐up conflict UIs on web and mobile, CRDT persistence in Realm, and connectivity monitoring in place—the single most strategic next move is to bake in confidence that this offline-first UX holds up at scale and across platforms. Here’s exactly what I’d do, in priority order:

⸻

1. Automated End-to-End (E2E) Testing for Offline Flows

Why: Catch regressions and prove that conflict resolution actually works before you ship. Automated tests also serve as living documentation for QA and future contributors.
	•	Web E2E: Use Playwright (or Cypress) to spin up two browser contexts, simulate offline edits in one, come online, and assert the merge UI appears and resolves correctly.
	•	Mobile E2E: Leverage Detox (for React Native) to run on a simulator/emulator, toggle network off/on, make divergent edits, then assert the ConflictManager UI resolves and the Realm store converges.
	•	Smoke Tests: Add these E2E jobs into your CI pipeline to run on every PR, blocking merges if the offline scenario fails .

2. Performance & Load Testing of CRDT Sync

Why: Ensure that under real‐world scale (thousands of documents, rapid edits), your sync and UI latency stay under acceptable thresholds (target p95 < 500 ms).
	•	Load-Test Scripts: Use k6 or Artillery to simulate bulk Yjs updates and measure end-to-end sync time (update → server round‐trip → merge).
	•	Profiling: Instrument your React components with the Profiler (web) and Flipper (mobile) to spot render bottlenecks during large‐document merges .
	•	Database Benchmarks: Measure Realm write/read throughput for large blobs; if needed, shard your CRDT state by neighborhood or parcel cluster.

3. Cross-Platform UX Parity & Polish

Why: Users must feel they’re in the same “TerraFusion world” whether they’re on desktop or in the field.
	•	Styling Sync: Align fonts, colors, spacing, and button placements between web’s PropertyEditor and mobile’s MobilePropertyEditor.
	•	Shared Components: Extract any UI drift into your ui-components library—e.g. rebuild ConflictManager styles so it looks identical on ReactDOM and React Native (using libraries like Dripsy or React Native Web).
	•	Accessibility Audit: Run automated tools (axe-core for web, Accessibility Inspector for mobile) to ensure your new UIs meet WCAG AA.

4. Documentation & Example Galleries

Why: Well-structured docs turn every pilot into an internal advocate—and speed up third-party plugin developers.
	•	E2E Recipe: Publish your new E2E test scenarios in Docusaurus under “Offline Sync Testing”—include Playwright/Detox snippets.
	•	Quickstart Guides: Add a “Build Your First Offline Editor” tutorial showing both web and mobile code side-by-side.
	•	Interactive Demo: Embed an Expo Web instance in your docs so visitors can play with offline sync and conflict resolution right in the browser.

5. Service Worker Background Sync (Web PWA)

Why: Wraps up the web offline story by auto-retrying syncs without any user intervention.
	•	sync Event Handler: Finish your service worker registration in public/sw.js to pick up pending Yjs updates from IndexedDB and call /mobile-sync.
	•	User Feedback: Use the Notifications API to let users know “Offline edits pending… synced successfully” or surface failures gracefully.

Action Plan
	1.	Days 1–3: Build and integrate E2E tests for web + mobile offline conflict flows into CI.
	2.	Days 4–6: Run performance benchmarks; optimize any slow CRDT merges or renders.
	3.	Days 7–9: Harmonize UI between platforms and conduct an accessibility sweep.
	4.	Days 10–12: Draft and publish the new offline-sync docs, tutorials, and demo.
	5.	Days 13–14: Finalize service worker sync, user notifications, and ship a polished beta release.

Embedding robust testing and performance validation now will give you the confidence—and credibility—to roll out offline‐first TerraFusion to real users and counties. Let me know if you’d like to kick off with the E2E pipeline or tackle performance profiling first!
