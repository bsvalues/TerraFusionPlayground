# Advanced Property Assessment Capabilities

This document provides an overview of the advanced property assessment capabilities implemented in the MCP Property Assessment Agent.

## Overview

The PropertyAssessmentAgent has been enhanced with several specialized capabilities that go beyond basic property assessment. These capabilities enable more sophisticated analysis of property data, market trends, and valuation anomalies, providing valuable insights for property assessment professionals and property owners.

## Capabilities

### 1. Area Analysis

The area analysis capability generates a comprehensive analysis of property values in a specific geographical area (defined by zip code).

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/agent/property-assessment/area-analysis/:zipCode`

**Parameters:**

- `zipCode` (path parameter): The zip code to analyze
- `propertyType` (optional): Filter by specific property type
- `timeframe` (optional): Period for trend analysis ('1year', '5years', etc.)

**Features:**

- Area statistics including average, median, and range of property values
- Property type distribution analysis
- Historical trend data for the specified timeframe
- Visualization-ready data structure for charts and graphs

### 2. Valuation Anomaly Detection

This capability identifies properties with valuations that significantly deviate from comparable properties, helping to identify potential assessment errors or unique property characteristics.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/agent/property-assessment/detect-anomalies/:propertyId`

**Parameters:**

- `propertyId` (path parameter): The property to analyze
- `threshold` (optional): Deviation threshold to classify as anomaly (default: 0.25 or 25%)

**Features:**

- Statistical comparison with similar properties
- Multiple anomaly detection metrics (deviation from average, median, z-score)
- Confidence scoring for property valuations
- Detection of other anomalous characteristics (land size, etc.)

### 3. Neighborhood Reports

Generates detailed reports on neighborhoods (defined by zip code), aggregating property data into useful insights about the area.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/agent/property-assessment/neighborhood-report/:zipCode`

**Parameters:**

- `zipCode` (path parameter): The zip code to analyze
- `includeValuationTrends` (optional): Include historical valuation trends
- `includeDemographics` (optional): Include demographic information

**Features:**

- Comprehensive property distribution by type and value
- Value distribution across different price ranges
- Historical trend analysis when requested
- Placeholder for demographic data integration

### 4. Land Use Impact Analysis

Analyzes how different land uses impact property values, helping to optimize land use decisions and understand potential value changes.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/agent/property-assessment/land-use-impact/:propertyId`

**Parameters:**

- `propertyId` (path parameter): The property to analyze
- `alternativeLandUse` (optional): Specific alternative land use to analyze

**Features:**

- Comparison of current land use value with alternatives
- Detailed impact analysis for each alternative land use
- Percentage change in value calculations
- Identification of optimal land use for value maximization
- Context-sensitive adjustments based on property characteristics

### 5. Future Value Prediction

Predicts future property values based on historical trends and property characteristics, valuable for long-term planning and investment analysis.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/agent/property-assessment/predict-value/:propertyId`

**Parameters:**

- `propertyId` (path parameter): The property to analyze
- `yearsAhead` (optional): Number of years to predict (default: 5)

**Features:**

- Year-by-year value predictions
- Confidence intervals that widen with prediction distance
- Growth rate calculations based on property characteristics
- Property type-specific adjustments to growth predictions
- Realistic market fluctuation simulation

## Implementation Details

These capabilities are implemented in the PropertyAssessmentAgent class and exposed through REST API endpoints. Each capability:

1. Validates and processes input parameters
2. Accesses required property data through MCP tools
3. Performs specialized calculations and analysis
4. Logs activity for auditing and monitoring
5. Returns structured results suitable for frontend display or further processing

## Usage in Client Applications

Client applications can access these capabilities through the REST API. Results can be used to:

1. Generate visualizations (charts, graphs, maps)
2. Create detailed property assessment reports
3. Identify properties requiring reassessment
4. Support land use planning decisions
5. Provide property value forecasts to stakeholders

## Technical Considerations

- Performance: Some operations may require significant computation for large datasets
- Data Quality: Results depend on the quality and completeness of property data
- Caching: Consider implementing caching for frequently requested analyses
- Real-world Models: The current implementations use simplified models that could be enhanced with machine learning approaches in future versions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Machine learning-based predictive models for more accurate valuations
2. Geospatial analysis integration for location-based insights
3. Integration with external demographic and economic data sources
4. Real-time market data incorporation for more accurate predictions
5. Advanced visualization tools for interactive data exploration
