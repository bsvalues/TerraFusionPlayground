# TerraFusion County Network Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying TerraFusion in county network environments, with specific focus on security, compliance, and integration requirements.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Windows Server 2019 or later
- 16GB RAM minimum
- 4 CPU cores minimum
- 100GB free disk space
- Network connectivity to county systems
- Administrative access to network resources

### Network Requirements
- Dedicated VLAN for TerraFusion components
- Firewall rules configured for required ports
- SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication
- Access to county DNS services
- VPN access for remote administration

## Security Measures

### Network Security
1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Allow inbound traffic on ports 3000, 4000, 5000 (HTTPS)
   - Restrict access to county IP ranges only
   - Enable logging for all TerraFusion-related traffic

2. **SSL/TLS Implementation**
   - Use county-issued SSL certificates
   - Enable TLS 1.3
   - Configure strong cipher suites
   - Regular certificate rotation

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement IP whitelisting
   - Use county Active Directory integration
   - Enable MFA for all administrative access
   - Regular access review and audit

### Data Security
1. **Encryption**
   - Data at rest encryption
   - Data in transit encryption
   - Key management procedures
   - Regular key rotation

2. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Daily automated backups
   - Offsite backup storage
   - Regular recovery testing
   - Retention policy compliance

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```powershell
# Run as administrator
.\scripts\security-setup.bat
```

### 2. Component Deployment
```powershell
# Deploy all components
.\scripts\start-all.bat
```

### 3. Integration Configuration
1. Configure county system integrations
2. Set up data synchronization
3. Test all integration points
4. Document integration status

### 4. Security Validation
1. Run security scan
2. Verify firewall rules
3. Test backup procedures
4. Validate access controls

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### System Monitoring
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory utilization
   - Disk space
   - Network traffic

2. **Security Monitoring**
   - Access logs
   - Error logs
   - Security events
   - Integration status

### Regular Maintenance
