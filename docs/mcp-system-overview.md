# Model Context Protocol (MCP) System Overview

## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a secure framework for AI-assisted property assessment in the Benton County Assessor's Office. It provides a controlled environment for AI agents to access property data, perform assessments, and generate insights while maintaining strict permission controls and audit trails.

## System Architecture

The MCP system consists of the following key components:

### Agent System

The Agent System manages and coordinates specialized AI agents. Each agent has a defined set of capabilities and permissions, and can access MCP tools appropriate to its role. The agent system handles:

- Agent initialization and lifecycle management
- Capability execution and error handling
- Performance monitoring and status tracking
- Inter-agent coordination and communication

### Core Agents

#### Property Assessment Agent

Specializes in property valuation and assessment with capabilities:

- `analyzeProperty`: Comprehensive property analysis
- `generatePropertyStory`: Creates narrative property descriptions
- `findComparableProperties`: Identifies similar properties for comparison
- `calculatePropertyValue`: Estimates property values using various methods
- `analyzePropertyTrends`: Identifies value trends over time
- `generateComparableAnalysis`: Detailed analysis using comparable sales

#### Data Ingestion Agent

Manages data import/export operations with capabilities:

- `importFromFTP`: Imports property data from FTP servers
- `validateImportData`: Validates data before import
- `loadValidatedData`: Loads validated data into the system
- `exportToFTP`: Exports property data to FTP servers

#### Reporting Agent

Handles report generation with capabilities:

- `createReport`: Creates new report templates
- `runReport`: Executes reports against property data
- `listReports`: Lists available reports
- `getReportHistory`: Retrieves report execution history
- `scheduleReport`: Schedules regular report execution

### MCP Service

The MCP Service provides a secure interface for agents to access data and functionality, with:

- Tool registration and discovery
- Permission enforcement
- Request validation
- Execution logging
- Audit trail maintenance

## Permission Model

The MCP system uses a comprehensive permission model:

- Agents have defined permission sets
- Each MCP tool has required permissions
- All access is validated against these permissions
- Authentication verification for each request
- Role-based access control

## Logging and Auditing

The system maintains detailed logs:

- Tool execution logs with parameters and results
- Agent activity logs
- System activity logs
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

## API Integration

The MCP system is exposed through a RESTful API that allows:

- Agent capability execution
- System status monitoring
- Agent lifecycle management
- Direct execution of MCP tools with proper authentication

## Security Measures

Security is maintained through:

- Authentication for all requests
- Permission validation
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Comprehensive logging

## Integration Points

The system integrates with:

- PACS (Property Appraisal and Collection System)
- FTP services for data import/export
- External AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity)
- Authentication services
