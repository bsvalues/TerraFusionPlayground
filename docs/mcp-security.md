# MCP Security Architecture

This document outlines the security architecture of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) system for the Benton County Assessor's Office platform.

## Overview

The MCP security architecture implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of security controls to protect sensitive property data and system integrity.

## Security Layers

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: All MCP endpoints require valid authentication via JWT tokens or API keys
- **Role-based Access Control**: Three access levels (read-only, read-write, admin) with granular permissions
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived tokens (1-hour default) to minimize the risk of token theft
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation, storage, and validation with optional IP restrictions

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Schema Validation**: All MCP tool parameters are validated against Zod schemas
- **Parameter Type Checking**: Strong type checking to prevent type confusion attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Removal of potentially dangerous characters and sequences
- **Numeric Bounds Checking**: Validation of numeric parameters against reasonable limits

### 3. Threat Detection

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Pattern detection for common SQL injection attempts
- **XSS Payload Detection**: Identification of script tags and JavaScript execution patterns
- **Command Injection Protection**: Filtering of shell command characters and escape sequences
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Normalization and validation of file paths

### 4. Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **Request Rate Limiting**: Prevention of brute force and denial-of-service attacks
- **IP-based Throttling**: Limiting requests from specific IP addresses when suspicious activity is detected
- **Progressive Backoff**: Increasing delays for repeated failed authentication attempts

### 5. Logging and Monitoring

- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Detailed logs of all authentication attempts and MCP tool executions
- **Security Event Logging**: Specific logging of security-related events and policy violations
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Monitoring for unusual access patterns or potential abuse

## Tool-Specific Security Controls

### Property Data Access

- **Filtered Results**: Tools that return property data implement access control filters
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive information is masked based on user's access level
- **Scope Limitations**: Results are limited based on user's authorized data scope

### Map Generation

- **Secure URL Generation**: Map URLs are generated using secure hash-based coordinates
- **No Direct Location Exposure**: Raw latitude/longitude are not exposed in responses
- **Parameter Validation**: All map parameters are validated before processing

### PACS Integration

- **Secure Connection**: All PACS API calls use secure, authenticated connections
- **Minimal Privilege**: PACS integration uses accounts with minimal required privileges
- **Data Validation**: All data retrieved from PACS is validated before processing

## Security Testing

The security architecture is validated through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual security components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing security controls across system boundaries
3. **Security Scans**: Regular automated scanning for common vulnerabilities
4. **Authentication Tests**: Comprehensive testing of authentication and authorization mechanisms
5. **Malicious Input Testing**: Testing with known attack patterns to verify detection and prevention

## Example Security Flow

For an MCP tool request:

1. Request arrives with JWT token or API key
2. Authentication middleware validates the token/key and extracts user information
3. Authorization check verifies user has required permissions for the requested tool
4. Rate limiting service checks if request rate exceeds allowed limits
5. Input validation confirms parameters match expected types and formats
6. Security service scans for malicious patterns in inputs
7. MCP service executes the requested tool with validated parameters
8. Results are filtered based on user's access level
9. Comprehensive logging records the request, parameters, and result status
10. Response is returned to the client

## Security Considerations for AI Integration

As the MCP system interacts with AI agents and models, special considerations include:

1. **Prompt Injection Protection**: Preventing manipulation of AI through carefully crafted inputs
2. **Output Validation**: Validating AI-generated responses before returning to clients
3. **Context Isolation**: Maintaining strict boundaries between AI contexts to prevent information leakage
4. **Deterministic Operation**: Ensuring AI agents operate within well-defined constraints

## Conclusion

The MCP security architecture provides a robust, multi-layered approach to protecting sensitive property data and system integrity. By implementing defense-in-depth strategies and comprehensive security controls, the system maintains a high level of security while enabling the functionality required by the Benton County Assessor's Office.
