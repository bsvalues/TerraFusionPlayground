# TerraFusion Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the TerraFusion platform to ensure data integrity, privacy, and compliance with security best practices.

## Security Scanning in CI Pipeline

The TerraFusion platform includes comprehensive security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline, implemented in `ci-templates/security-scan.yml`. This ensures that every code change is automatically checked for security vulnerabilities before being deployed.

### Implemented Security Scans

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**

   - Uses npm audit to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Produces reports of found vulnerabilities with severity ratings
   - Automatically fails builds with critical vulnerabilities

2. **Code Security Scanning**

   - Uses ESLint with security plugins to identify potential code vulnerabilities
   - Checks for common security issues like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
   - Enforces secure coding practices

3. **Secret Detection**

   - Uses detect-secrets to identify accidentally committed secrets
   - Prevents API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information from being leaked
   - Creates a baseline of allowed patterns

4. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**

   - Uses SonarCloud for thorough code analysis
   - Identifies complex security vulnerabilities
   - Provides detailed fix recommendations

5. **Infrastructure as Code Scanning**

   - Scans Terraform configurations for security issues
   - Ensures cloud infrastructure follows security best practices

6. **Container Security Scanning**

   - Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities
   - Helps maintain secure container deployments

7. **Software Composition Analysis**
   - Uses OWASP Dependency-Check for comprehensive dependency analysis
   - Identifies vulnerabilities in direct and transitive dependencies
   - Provides detailed reports for remediation

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- Secure login with industry-standard authentication protocols
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Session management with appropriate timeouts
- CSRF protection on all forms and API endpoints

### Data Security

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Secure communications with TLS/SSL
- Database connection security with parameterized queries
- Input validation on all user-provided data

### QGIS Integration Security

The integration with QGIS, our primary mapping system, includes several security measures:

1. **Sandboxed Execution**

   - QGIS processing runs in an isolated environment
   - Limited access to system resources

2. **Validated Inputs**

   - All GIS inputs are validated before processing
   - Prevents injection attacks in GIS operations

3. **Resource Limiting**

   - Memory and CPU usage limits on GIS operations
   - Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

4. **Output Sanitization**
   - GIS operation results are sanitized before being returned
   - Prevents XSS and other attacks in visualizations

## Security Testing

In addition to automated scanning, the TerraFusion platform undergoes:

1. **Regular Security Audits**

   - Conducted by third-party security professionals
   - Comprehensive review of entire system

2. **Penetration Testing**

   - Simulated attacks to identify vulnerabilities
   - Both authenticated and unauthenticated testing

3. **Security-focused Code Reviews**
   - Manual review of security-critical components
   - Verification of proper security implementation

## Compliance

The TerraFusion platform is designed to assist organizations in maintaining compliance with:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- OWASP Security Standards
- Local government data protection requirements

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. The issue is immediately assessed and contained
2. Affected parties are notified according to applicable regulations
3. Root cause analysis is performed
4. Remediation steps are implemented
5. Post-incident review improves future security
