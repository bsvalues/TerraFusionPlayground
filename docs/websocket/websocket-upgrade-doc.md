# WebSocket System Upgrade

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the WebSocket communication system in TerraFusion to address Error Code 1006 issues and create a more robust real-time communication infrastructure.

## Key Components

### 1. MainWebSocketServer (server/services/main-websocket-server.ts)

A centralized, singleton WebSocket server implementation with enhanced features:

- **Client Management**: Comprehensive tracking of connected clients with metadata
- **Connection States**: Proper state management (connecting, connected, disconnecting, disconnected, error)
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Automatic detection and cleanup of dead connections
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels
- **Metrics Collection**: Detailed metrics for monitoring and debugging
- **Reconnection Logic**: Support for graceful reconnection attempts

### 2. Enhanced Logger (server/utils/logger.ts)

Improved logging capabilities specifically for WebSocket communications:

- **WebSocket-specific Logging**: Dedicated methods for WebSocket logging
- **Structured Output**: JSON-formatted logs with consistent structure
- **Log Levels**: Support for different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Configurable**: Environment variable controlled logging levels
- **Error Formatting**: Better error object handling

### 3. Testing Tools (robust-websocket-test.html)

A comprehensive testing interface for WebSocket connections:

- **Visual Connection Status**: Real-time connection state visualization
- **Message Testing**: Ability to send different types of messages
- **Advanced Configuration**: Detailed connection parameter configuration
- **Diagnostics**: Tools for connection diagnostics and testing
- **Logs**: Separate logs for connection events and messages

## Integration

The system is integrated into the existing architecture:

1. **MainWebSocketServer** handles all WebSocket connections at the `/ws` path
2. **Legacy WebSocket Server** maintains backward compatibility at `/ws-legacy`
3. **Logger** provides enhanced visibility into WebSocket operations

## Benefits

- **Improved Stability**: Significantly reduces Error Code 1006 occurrences
- **Better Debuggability**: Enhanced logging and metrics for troubleshooting
- **Centralized Management**: Single point of control for all WebSocket connections
- **Resilience**: Automatic recovery from temporary network issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics for connection quality and latency

## Testing

A comprehensive test page is available at `/robust-websocket-test.html` to:

- Test WebSocket connections
- Send different message types
- Monitor connection metrics
- Observe reconnection behavior
- Diagnose connection issues

## Next Steps

1. Migrate existing WebSocket services to use the MainWebSocketServer
2. Add additional metrics for specific message types and performance
3. Implement client-side reconnection improvements in production frontend code
4. Add server-side load balancing for high-volume WebSocket traffic
